#Here are the assignement guidelines for your reference

#You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
#Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
#Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
#From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.



The following is the sequence in which the code creates the output.

#Reading the files for the database


# Merging the two data sets i.e test and train data

#  selecting the required coloumns from the entire data set

#renaming the activites with the description

# renaming the variables with descriptive names

#generating the tidy data set grouped by student and activity
